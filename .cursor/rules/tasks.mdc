# Tasks Lists

You may be asked to create a task list and then execute tasks. The following is guidance for this task list:
- You should create the task list within the package you are working within.
- The last task should always be "Delete this task list".
- Always check off the task when you are done.
- We should add a section to the task list which outlines assumptions we are making about our tasks.
- We should also add a section which provides file structure information for the package we are working within.
